# Whack-A-Mole
## History

Mogura Taiji (モグラ退治, "Mole Buster'') was invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada. It is traditionally a five hole game that has moles popping out randomly. The objective is to hit as many moles as possible on the head before they slink back into their holes, increasing your score each time. Mogura Taiji made its North American debut in November 1976 at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) show, where it drew attention for being the first mallet game of its type. Gerald Denton and Donny Anderson adapted  it into a carnival game by putting it in a trailer. Mr. Denton showed the game to Aaron Fechter and asked him to build them a version of the game. Mr Fechter redesigned the game by adding air cylinders, so that when the air pushed up moles , the air acted as a cushion. The air cylinders also made the game more reliable. He renamed the game "Whac-A-Mole.
